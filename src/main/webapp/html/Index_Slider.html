				<br>
				<br> we have created this site aaspaasdoctor.com because in
				case of emergency our first question in hindi is "koi doctor hai
				aaspaas" means is their any doctor available near by. Almost we all
				have encountered this situation in our life. This situation get
				worst in rural areas of our country. Our platform aaspaasdoctor.com
				will connect each individual to nearby medical facilities and it
				will save many life's as well as time of many person. Another
				problem is when we take appointment with doctor we have to
				physically visit their if doctor is not available then our time and
				efforts are gone waste . To solve all this kind of problem we have
				come up with platform aaspaasdoctor.com to solve these problems..<a
